## To Do <!-- omit from toc -->

## Introduction
- **Abstraction:** higher level only needs to know about interface to lower level, not how its implemented


## Misc
- **Meltdown & Spectre:**
  - speculative execution leaves traces of data in cache
  - malicious program can inspect cache contents to infer secret data
- **Rowhammer:**
  - repeatedly accessing a DRAM row enough times drains charge in adjacent rows
  - this electrical interference can be used to predictably induce bit flips
  - > it's like breaking into an apartment by repeatedly slamming a neighbor's door until vibrations open the door you were after
