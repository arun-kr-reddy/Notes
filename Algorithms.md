## To Do <!-- omit from toc -->
- Big O Notation
- Proof by Induction
- Proof by Contradiction
- Recurrence Relations
- **Method:** ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ot9ssf/comment/h6tx1vx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), [medium](https://medium.com/@rajbopche/my-preparation-for-algo-ds-193c90952d8c))
  - if no progress within first 10min then mark it (for review later), watch video solution & then code it yourself
  - short notes for each problem:
    - approach with pseducode in short
    - new trick/pattern involved
    - time & space complexity
  - give yourself time to forget and retry marked problems after 2 weeks
  - goal is to understand the problem not memorize solution
    - if you can't solve new problems then you are memorizing solutions
  - first time will take multiple months but getting back into it next time will just take weeks
