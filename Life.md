## Personal Finance
- **Why Sell ESOPs on Vest:**
  - if you had cash, would you buy company stock?
  - stock falling in future and losing your job are highly correlated
  - unvested stocks & salary increments already give exposure to company's growth
- **Why not Track Every Rupee:**
  - waste of time if already hitting your savings goal and got impulses largely under control
  - energy should be spent on making money and keeping yourself healthy & happy
